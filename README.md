Nogine2 is a game development framework developed in Rust aiming to have **minimal dependencies** on distribution builds. It is highly inspired by how Gamemaker Studio 2 does things.

Nogine2 is **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT BATTLE TESTED**. For an even more unusable experience refer to [the first Nogine](https://github.com/the-melionara/nogine).
